## 🧠 Core Philosophy

SharmElSheikhTravel is **not a booking engine**.  
It is a **destination-first, beach-first travel knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- generate itinerary variants (3-day, 5-day, 10-day, 30-day)
- cluster resorts by vibe, price, and beach quality
- translate and localize guidance
- generate visual-first summaries

Humans are required to:
- verify beach conditions and access
- validate safety and reef etiquette
- keep resort info current
- prevent misinformation

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

SharmElSheikhTravel is built around **Red Sea beach and resort entities**.

### Core Entities
- Destination Node (Sharm El Sheikh)
- Resort Zone / Area
- Beach / Swim Zone
- Resort / Hotel
- Snorkeling Spot / Reef Access Point
- Café / Work Spot
- Digital Nomad Guide
- Itinerary
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by beach, resort, and long-stay intent
- is programmatically generatable
